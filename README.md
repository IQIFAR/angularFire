## project background
This project is about making a simple and easy-to-use chat web app. The app will allow people to send and receive messages in real time. To build this, we will use Firebase Console, which provides tools like a database to store messages, authentication for user login, and hosting to put the app online.
Firebase makes it easy to create apps because it handles a lot of the hard work, like managing servers. The real-time database ensures messages are sent and received quickly, and authentication allows users to log in safely using email, passwords, or Google accounts.
The goal of this project is to create a friendly chat app that is fast, secure, and simple to use. It also helps developers learn how to use Firebase to build modern web apps.

## disscussion
During the project, I learned how to use the terminal to download and set up Command Line Interface (CLI) tools. I practiced basic terminal commands like cd, ls, and mkdir to move around folders and create new ones. I also learned how to download tools using commands and how to install CLI tools, like Firebase CLI, by typing npm install -g firebase-tools. This skill is helpful because it makes it easier to manage tools and save time by automating tasks.
I also learned how to set up the Firebase Console to make a real-time chat web app. First, I created a new project in the Firebase Console. Then, I enabled services like Firestore Database and Authentication to store data and allow users to log in. I set up login options like email and password or Google Sign-In. Finally, I added Firebase to the web app by copying the configuration file and pasting it into the code. This showed me how Firebase can make it easy to build apps that are fast and user-friendly.
Overall, this session helped me understand important tools for web development. These skills will help me work on projects in a simpler and more effective way.
